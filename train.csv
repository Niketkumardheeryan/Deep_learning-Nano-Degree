0x3f9,22.0,"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty. Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a ‚Äúlid‚Äù to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes ‚Äúdead lime‚Äù, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It‚Äôs basically the ‚ÄòGlue‚Äô that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\nÔºçSukiyaki SauceÔºç\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\nÔºçVegetablesÔºç\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25¬∞C/77¬∞F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15¬∞C/59¬∞F 20 hours\nWinter: 5¬∞C/41¬∞F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75¬∞C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

0x407,25.0,"Rep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the House committee that grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, told VICE News it may be time for other tech CEOs to come before his committee to outline their own data privacy practices.\n\n‚ÄúThis is not just a Facebook issue,‚Äù he said in an interview, noting that other internet companies scrape and sell access to consumers‚Äô data just like Facebook.\n\nWalden, an Oregon Republican, said he‚Äôd like to know from companies like Amazon or Google, ‚Äúwhat are their protections, what are their user agreements? What should we know about their activities? What can they better regulate themselves, so we don't have to over-regulate here?‚Äù \n\nWalden chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Zuckerberg answered five hours worth of questions from members Thursday on everything ranging from its data sharing practices to its efforts to crack down on foreign election medddling. It was the Facebook CEO‚Äôs second round of questioning on the Hill, after he testified in front of a Senate panel on Tuesday ‚Äî part of an apology tour on Capitol Hill meant to reassure lawmakers in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. \n\nWalden ‚Äî an Oregon Republican whose district is home to three Facebook data centers ‚Äî has been cautious on enacting new regulations to prevent similar abuses in the past. After Zuckerberg's testimony, Walden said he was still giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt when it came to implementing reforms to its data policies.\n\n‚ÄúThey've got to show the consumer just us the consumer that they understand their problem, they're going to fix it and we're not going to see another apology tour in six months or two years from now,‚Äù he said.\n\nIf Facebook fails to do so, Walden added, ‚Äúthere are things in terms of how we can better control our own data I think if they don't fix we can.‚Äù\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

0x41e,17.0,"It seemed like the Pittsburgh Steelers won and tight end Jesse James would be the hero with a game-winning touchdown catch in the final minute against the New England Patriots. But if you‚Äôve watched the NFL long enough, you know that a catch is often not a catch.\n\nThe NFL‚Äôs oft-criticized catch rule might determine where the AFC championship game is held. In the final seconds of a thrilling game Sunday, James caught a pass just short of the goal line, and as he was going down he crossed the goal line for what looked like a touchdown. In the CBS booth, Tony Romo and Jim Nantz couldn‚Äôt figure out why it was taking so long for replay review to confirm it.\n\nhttp://BlurredCulture.com"

0x421,25.0,"The ‚ÄúSilence Breakers‚Äù are outliers. Most assault goes unreported.\n\nSources:\n\nTIME‚Äôs reporting: http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers\nand http://time.com/5052362/time-person-of-the-year-2017-arm-cover\nRAINN statistics: https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system \nEEOC report (PDF): https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_force/harassment/upload/report.pdf \n\nTime magazine named the Silence Breakers its Person of the Year for 2017. These are the women and men who shared their stories of assault, harassment, and hostility and publicly named their alleged abusers. But the story goes beyond the magazine‚Äôs cover.\n\nThat elbow in the lower right-hand corner is attached to a young hospital worker from Texas, who anonymously reported her harassment for fear of the negative impact it could have on her and her family. It represents a much larger contingent than the women on the cover: the silence keepers.\n\nSexual harassment and sexual assault are both underreported. A government study by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that about 70 percent of harassment is never reported. The same report aggregated a study that found when people did report harassment, about 75 percent of faced some sort of retaliation for doing so.\n\nThe Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) studied the underlying reasons people don‚Äôt report, and, unsurprisingly, the above statistics are connected. According to RAINN, the No. 1 reason people don‚Äôt report their abuse and harassment is because they‚Äôre afraid of the repercussions.\n\nTime has made it a point to recognize the courage of the ‚ÄúSilence Breakers,‚Äù but it‚Äôs important to remember why their actions were brave: because there are far more people remaining silent, who feel that they don‚Äôt have the option of speaking up.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insist‚Ä¶.\nThis is not a military takeover of government. \n\nOnce praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabwe‚Äôs new constitution with the support of the people. \n\nBut soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator.\n\nHe secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of  state-sponsored torture and killings.\n\nAnd even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, there‚Äôs evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. \n\nNow that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs caused a split in Mugabe‚Äôs own party, the ZANU-PF.\nOn one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabe‚Äôs sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabwe‚Äôs independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.   \n\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

0x444,24.0,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, November 21st 2017) John talks about the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nMeghan Dunn - I really liked Murder on the Orient Express and I just heard that Fox is setting up a sequel with Death on the Nile. Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL‚Äôs poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

0x45c,24.0,"Hello everyone!\nI have realized that as an ASMR fan, my trigger preferences often carry over to when I'm creating my own content. I like faster/louder triggers and roleplays, so I realized that I don't tend to slow it down in many of my videos. This video is the opposite! Let's explore some triggers slowly and gently, with soft whispers ear to ear. :) I hope you enjoy!\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro 0:00\nCork Candle 2:25 \nSoft Bristle Brush 7:52\nTiny Lotion Jar 15:14\nKeyboard 21:50\nOutro 28:30\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy upload schedule:\n‚ñ∫Every Tuesday\n‚ñ∫Every Thursday\n‚ñ∫Every Saturday\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(üíñ‚òÄÔ∏èSeeking Therapy or Counseling?

I can totally relate with that, and ASMR is an awesome outlet for those things. However, if you‚Äôre interested, above is a link to a website with real, professional & licensed counselors. You can type to them, or call them! It‚Äôs actually a really cool service and I use it personally. It costs as low as $35 a week, and you don‚Äôt have to leave your house to use it. :)\n\n\nFTC: By using my BetterHelp referral link you are supporting this channel.

With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.\n\nFalcon Heavy's first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. \n\nFollowing liftoff, the two side boosters separate from the center core and return to landing sites for future reuse.  The center core, traveling further and faster than the side boosters, also returns for reuse, but lands on a drone ship located in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt max velocity the Roadster will travel 11 km/s (7mi/s) and travel 400 million km (250 million mi) from Earth."

0x4a5,24.0,"Actress Nicole Eggert discusses the police report she filed against her Charlie's in Charge co-star Scott Baio. Host Sara Gilbert gets emotional, reading a statement filed against Baio by their co-star Alexander Polinsky, He's a dear friend of mine, Gilbert shares, before she continues reading the statement about Baio acting 'inappropriately' to Eggert on set during the first season, calling him 'various homophobic slurs,' 'I received regular verbal attacks, mental abuse and I also suffered a physical assault at the hands of Scott Baio.' Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\nÔºçSukiyaki SauceÔºç\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\nÔºçVegetablesÔºç\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25¬∞C/77¬∞F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15¬∞C/59¬∞F 20 hours\nWinter: 5¬∞C/41¬∞F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75¬∞C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

0x4a9,25.0,"What would bring together the hyper-competitive people from Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest during the holidays? A good old-fashioned a cappella sing-off, that‚Äôs what. In late November the San Francisco Conservatory of Music hosted the fifth annual installment of ‚ÄúTechapella,‚Äùa showcase for the a cappella singing clubs of some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThe event was founded by Laolee Xiong, a security specialist at Facebook. It was initially a way to have a competition with his friends who sang in Google‚Äôs group, ‚ÄúGoogapella.‚Äù Then he mentioned it to his friend at Google and suggested that they do ‚Äúsome kind of Pitch Perfect-style sing-off,‚Äù said Xiong.\n\nAfter an informal singing battle at each of the tech giant‚Äôs campuses, the a cappella groups from other companies (Twitter has ‚ÄúThe Song Birds‚Äù and Pinterest has ‚Äúthe Pintunes‚Äù) reached out to Xiong to organize a larger event, and ‚ÄúTechapella‚Äù was born.

0x4b6,27.0,"It's a humbling situation, but much about who we are as adults can be traced back to things that happened to us before our 12th birthday. Part of learning to be an adulthood means making sense of the events of our childhood. We need to spot how our past might be trying to interfere with our chances in the present.

Our childhoods, even the apparently benign ones, leave us no option but to be anything else.\nAs a result of these childhoods, we tend, over most issues, to list ‚Äì like a sailing yacht in high wind ‚Äì far too much in one direction or another. We are too timid, or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or as desperate for another to complete us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end. What is certain is that these imbalances come at a huge cost, rendering us less able to exploit our talents and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying lives and a great deal less fun to be around‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/6ubziU\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://goo.gl/qf1h3j\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/b7FNXL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDirected by: Hannah & Martha¬†\n\nDesign: Hannah McNally\n\nAnimation Team: Flora Caulton, Emily Downe, Martha Halliday, Hannah McNally, Kathrin Steinbacher¬†\n\nwww.hannahandmartha.com\n\nwww.floracaulton.co.uk\n\nwww.emilydowne.co.uk\n\nwww.kathrinsteinbacher.com"

0x4d3,10.0,"Higher is the title song for Wildlife feature film Wild Amsterdam playing in cinemas across Holland now. More info: http://dutchnaturefilms.com. Taken from the album Don Diablo - FUTURE: http://www.tinyurl.com/DonDiabloFuture  \n\nA few years ago I had the honour of making the end credit as well as the title song for an independent film called The New Wilderness. Much to everyones surprise that film ended up becoming one of the highest grossing films in Dutch cinema history and a sequel seemed inevitable. That sequel is finally here and when they asked me to provide a title song once more I couldn't refuse. I love the passion, dedication and patience the film makers put into these films and being a longtime inhabitant of Amsterdam myself it felt extra special to be a part of this incredible project. \n\nDirected by: Mark Verkerk\nProduced by: Ignas van Schaick \nEdit: Thomas Pieket Weeserik \nAdditional Camerawork: Patrick Van Der Wal \nSFX: Erik Middendorp\nExecutive Producer: Don Diablo\n\nProduction Company: EMS Films Holland \n\n‚¨°‚¨¢ Don Diablo ‚¨¢‚¨°\nSpotify ‚¨° http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo\nMerch ‚¨° http://shop.dondiablo.com\nInstagram ‚¨° http://instagram.com/dondiablo\nFacebook ‚¨° http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo\nTwitter ‚¨° http://twitter.com/dondiablo\nYouTube ‚¨° http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1\nSoundCloud ‚¨° http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo"

You can find out more about them here: https://www.erdbebenwarte.de/\n\nThree things I had to cut out of this video, because they didn't quite fit into the story or because I couldn't film them:\n\nThe reason the steel ball survived two world wars is because the university's records listed it by use as a rock-ball, not by composition as a steel ball - so no-one melted it down for weaponry.\n\nThe observatory team refill that pit every year to make the ground flat, and the ball just digs a hole again. The rock's just being compressed underneath. They joke that, somewhere in Australia, there's a slowly growing hill...\n\nAnd finally, the ground steams for a little while after the ball hits: it gets rather warm...\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin (@mrsmmartin)\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"
0x4fa,28.0,"For more than half a decade I've suffered from lactose intolerance. If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only.

At Shuko, one of the premiere sushi restaurants in NYC, the menu is driven by the imaginations of Nick Kim and Jimmy Lau, as well as the whims of Mother Nature. Hyper-fresh cuts of bluefin tuna, squid, barracuda, and needlefish travel from the chefs' hands directly to the diners' plates. The result is a meal that flows seamlessly from one course to the next. One of Manhattan's most traditional omakase experiences, as well as one of its most boundary-pushing, Shuko is a bucket-list destination for sushi obsessives worldwide. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect."

0x534,10.0,"M√ò 'When I Was Young' Official Video \n\n‚ÄúI'm so happy to present this video because it feels very true to the song and to who I am. It was inspired by a painting called ‚ÄòThe Dance Of Life‚Äô by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It‚Äôs an illustration of three women‚Äîone in white, one in red and one in black‚Äîand tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it.

Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.\n\nBut Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company ‚Äî and viewers ‚Äî demanded.\n\nThough the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I had a lot of scrap hardwood flooring from our home renovations, so I found some really beautiful pieces and got to work.\nMost of the sword is made from left over cumaru teak flooring that I recently used in our house. It has a really beautiful grain pattern and some elegant figuring, plus it's extremely dense and hard. I had just finished watching Alec Steele's series on making a Damascus steel katana, so I had a rough idea on how the whole thing went together.\n\nFirst, I drew out the rough shape of the blade based on some online dimensions. I cut out this shape on the bandsaw making sure to leave a tang on the bottom that would fit inside the hilt. I rough sanded the blade to give the sword some definition and moved on to the tsuba, or hand guard.\n\nI found another smaller piece of teak flooring for the tsuba. I used some calipers to measure the tang dimensions and transferred those lines to the blank tsuba. I drilled out this space and had to chisel and file the pocket very carefully so that the blade tang would sit snuggly into it. After I had a good fit, ¬†I cut the tsuba into an oval using a paper template.\n\nAfter researching how katana hilts are wrapped in cotton or silk strips, I decided to recreate that look with an inlayed contrasting wood. I had a piece of scrap oak flooring from my boys' room which would look awesome against the teak hilt. While I worked on other projects, I had my friend Josh CNC out the hilt design and the resulting diamond pattern looked just like a traditional fabric wrap.¬†I hogged out the inside of the hilt to receive the tang and once I got a snug fit, it was time to assemble the major components.\n\nThe tsuba fit onto the tang and the tang fit into the hilt. I added a kashira or pommel to the end of the hilt and it was all done. I finished the katana with some linseed oil and beeswax polish and it looks gorgeous! I am so happy to have my own sword and I feel like a true samurai!\n\nIf you liked this woodworking prop, check out the playlist above for more!"

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept.

0x578,25.0,"Rep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the House committee that grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, told VICE News it may be time for other tech CEOs to come before his committee to outline their own data privacy practices.\n\n‚ÄúThis is not just a Facebook issue,‚Äù he said in an interview, noting that other internet companies scrape and sell access to consumers‚Äô data just like Facebook.\n\nWalden, an Oregon Republican, said he‚Äôd like to know from companies like Amazon or Google, ‚Äúwhat are their protections, what are their user agreements? What should we know about their activities? What can they better regulate themselves, so we don't have to over-regulate here?‚Äù \n\nWalden chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Zuckerberg answered five hours worth of questions from members Thursday on everything ranging from its data sharing practices to its efforts to crack down on foreign election medddling. It was the Facebook CEO‚Äôs second round of questioning on the Hill, after he testified in front of a Senate panel on Tuesday ‚Äî part of an apology tour on Capitol Hill meant to reassure lawmakers in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. \n\nWalden ‚Äî an Oregon Republican whose district is home to three Facebook data centers ‚Äî has been cautious on enacting new regulations to prevent similar abuses in the past. After Zuckerberg's testimony, Walden said he was still giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt when it came to implementing reforms to its data policies.\n\n‚ÄúThey've got to show the consumer just us the consumer that they understand their problem, they're going to fix it and we're not going to see another apology tour in six months or two years from now,‚Äù he said.\n\nIf Facebook fails to do so, Walden added, ‚Äúthere are things in terms of how we can better control our own data I think if they don't fix we can.‚Äù\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorgan‚Äôs good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you can‚Äôt help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryan‚Äôs face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven ‚Äî and these actresses and so many more have proven ‚Äî we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told.

0x57b,22.0,"This video lets you see a different aspect of a doctor's life. For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital. I believe it's a crucial topic and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nCOMMENT BELOW - I am really looking forward to having a conversation with you guys and hearing your thoughts!\n\nSUBSCRIBE to experience more of my journey as a junior doctor! \n\n~ Siobhan (aka Violin MD) ~\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n‚ô´ Background Music ‚ô´ \n\nRhodesia by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 - Scherzo"

It was back in 2016 when Lionsgate hired Hamilton star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to serve as a creative producer and musical mastermind on the feature film and TV series adaptations, along with Rothfuss. \n\nAccording to Variety, TriStar Pictures has landed worldwide distribution rights to the Mr. Rogers biopic ‚ÄúYou Are My Friend,‚Äù with Tom Hanks attached to play Mr. Rogers. Diary of a Teenage Girl director Marielle Heller is helming the pic from a script by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster. The film is inspired by a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and award-winning journalist Tom Junod. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nBleecker Street has released the first trailer for Unsane, a horror movie shot entirely on an iPhone by director Steven Soderbergh. The story follows a woman who‚Äôs convinced she sees her stalker everywhere, and who inadvertently admits herself to a psych ward. \n\nLionsgate has debuted the first trailer for Submergence, the romantic drama from Wings of Desire and Paris, Texas filmmaker Wim Wenders. Based on J.M. Ledgard‚Äôs 2013 novel, Submergence stars Alicia Vikander and James McAvoy as two lovers who met by chance.\n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\nFollow Brianne: https://twitter.com/MissMovies\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

0x5bd,25.0,"Nursing is the job of the future. So why have men stayed away?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to imagine that the jobs of the future, if they even exist, will all revolve around technology. But it turns out, the jobs that are least likely to succumb to automation are those that involve building human relationships. The healthcare field is a prime example‚Äî nurses, physician assistants, and physical therapists have higher-than-average salaries and major expected job growth. These fields share something else in common‚Äî they‚Äôre dominated by women. Despite the erosion of traditionally ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù fields like manufacturing, men just aren‚Äôt taking these high-paying, in-demand healthcare jobs in the numbers you‚Äôd expect. For decades, nursing in particular has been considered ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs work,‚Äù in part because it‚Äôs assumed that women, more so than men, have a kind of innate capacity for caring and empathy. But men in nursing say this mindset is holding us back. For them, caring and empathy are stills that can be developed, not traits someone is worth with or without based on their gender.\n\nOxford University study on which jobs are most vulnerable to automation: https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf\n\nMen in Nursing, History, Challenges, and Opportunities (book by Chad O'Lynn): http://www.springerpub.com/men-in-nursing.html\n\nFlorence Nightingale and the Nursing Legacy (book by Monica Baly): https://books.google.com/books/about/Florence_Nightingale_and_the_Nursing_Leg.html?id=9SdtAAAAMAAJ\n\nMarci Cottingham's studies on gender and healthcare work:\nRECRUITING MEN, CONSTRUCTING MANHOOD:\nHow Health Care Organizations Mobilize Masculinities as Nursing Recruitment Strategy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/km22il7hm9tbbpc/cottingham2013.pdf?dl=0\n\nCaring Moments and Their Men: Masculine Emotion Practice in Nursing: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hxqgm9u0a6i1bic/Cottingham2017.pdf?dl=0\n\nGender and emotion : social psychological perspectives / edited by Agneta H.

It's a simple question, though the answer is quite complicated. And it varies tremendously based on what car we're talking about. A $20,000 compact is far more simple than the $155,000 Mercedes S560 Cabriolet driven in this video. With that extra cost comes luxuriousness, the latest technology, and all kinds of features that most drivers will never even know the car has. \n\nOften, complexity is associated with unreliability, and though they may often correlate, that doesn't mean complexity causes unreliability. In the case of luxury cars, it's important to consider who the buyer is. In this video, we'll discuss why it may be a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers to have expensive cars that aren't necessarily reliable. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!"

0x62b,26.0,"Earthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you‚Äôre prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you‚Äôre prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don‚Äôt forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you‚Äôll need, medications, and supplies that you‚Äôll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don‚Äôt require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt‚Äôs best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"
0x62c,24.0,"Timelapse video of a complete log cabin build by one man alone in the wilderness of Canada, from 1st tree I cut to last floor board I laid. If you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer. It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the Log Cabin The Bear Den playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nTo see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/"

But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father‚Äôs legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)‚Äîwho is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious‚Äô Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. \n\nPacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix‚Äôs Daredevil, STARZ‚Äôs Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. \n\n#JoinTheUprising #PacificRimUprising"

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‚Äòreturn to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander‚Äôs household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids ‚Äì where anyone could be a spy for Gilead ‚Äì all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

0x64e,28.0,"Following its first test launch, Falcon Heavy is now the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

Built by Sarah Winchester, (Academy Award¬Æ-winner Helen Mirren) heiress to the Winchester fortune, it is a house that knows no end.  Constructed in an incessant twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week mania for decades, it stands seven stories tall and contains hundreds of rooms.  To the outsider it looks like a monstrous monument to a disturbed woman‚Äôs madness. But Sarah is not building for herself, for her niece (Sarah Snook) or for the troubled Doctor Eric Price (Jason Clarke) whom she has summoned to the house.  She is building a prison, an asylum for hundreds of vengeful ghosts, and the most terrifying among them have a score to settle with the Winchesters‚Ä¶"

This would make the U.S. the only country in the world with an embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - there are currently various consulates, but no embassies. The announcement spurred condemnation from various countries, including U.S. allies, and has quickly become a political flashpoint of the Middle East.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond automatically to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.  (Note: This testing does not irritate or harm the robot.)"

The ketogenic diet is the latest in popular diets in the US. It shares many similarities with the Atkins diet; it‚Äôs low-to-no carbs, some protein, and a lot of delicious fat.\n\nThe keto diet isn‚Äôt exactly new. It‚Äôs been used to treat epilepsy since the 1920s, and it‚Äôs had promising outcomes from treating Type 2 Diabetes. However, epilepsy and diabetes aren‚Äôt the only reason people give the ketogenic diet a try. It‚Äôs also used as a diet for weight loss. The diet banishes most carbs, including fruit, and opts-in for fatty foods like avocados, salmon, eggs, cheese, butter, oil, and the holy grail of fatty meats ‚Äî bacon.\n\nUnfortunately, science has not yet proven the keto diet to be the miraculous cure to losing weight, that some kept devotees claim it to be. The more extreme a diet, the harder it is to adhere to, and though the diet may be beneficial to some, that does not mean it will work for all who give it a try.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Host Sara Gilbert gets emotional, reading a statement filed against Baio by their co-star Alexander Polinsky, He's a dear friend of mine, Gilbert shares, before she continues reading the statement about Baio acting 'inappropriately' to Eggert on set during the first season, calling him 'various homophobic slurs,' 'I received regular verbal attacks, mental abuse and I also suffered a physical assault at the hands of Scott Baio.' Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

0x6dc,17.0,"The bicycle industry is almost entirely comprised of enthusiasts and dreamers, but the crew at the San Luis Obispo development facility takes it to a level of intensity that is simply a notch higher. The SLO team operates as a true competitive family‚Äîthe kind in which you refuse to be one-upped by your sibling, but where you become the world‚Äôs loudest cheerleader when your sibling wins. \n\nThis competitive family dynamic is abundantly evident in the SLO group‚Äôs newest creation, DUB. This is a product that you don‚Äôt see or hear. It‚Äôs a product whose measure of success is when you‚Äôre not thinking about it. And yet the development team‚Äôs excitement for this new product is motivating, even contagious.\n\nTasked with creating a lighter crankset, the engineers here could have easily phoned it in‚Äîchecked the spreadsheet boxes, so to speak. But this is a group of individuals that attacks Movember as if it were the Mountain Bike World Championships, so ‚Äòjust checking the box‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really fall into the vernacular. They didn‚Äôt want any checked-box product on their bikes, so they made something better. \n\nDUB, as they called it, is a simple solution to an often-tedious problem. DUB is a bottom bracket spindle and bearing design that allows lighter cranksets. DUB allows better bearing seals for better performance over the long term. DUB allows SRAM‚Äôs test engineers to perform more focused sets of tests. DUB is forward and backward compatible. DUB makes your life, as a bottom bracket user, easier. \n\nDUB is one more simple solution dreamed up, designed, developed, tested, ridden and loved by a dedicated group of people in San Luis Obispo who live to make better parts for the bicycles they ride."

0x710,28.0,"For more than half a decade I've suffered from lactose intolerance. If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there‚Äôs a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it‚Äôs great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from ‚Äî some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. \n\nAfter those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more and found delicious salads and pickled chilies that blew my mouth off, they were so hot and spicy!\n\nAfter this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!\n\nAfter exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. \n\nAfter eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.\n\nHere are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:\n\n1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square\n2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market\n3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market\n4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros\n5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER \n\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can .

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends.

While Britain created the immortal Spitfire, Lancaster and Edgley Optica, it also created a wealth of dangerous, disgraceful and diabolical designs. These are just ten plucked from a shortlist of thirty.  In defining ‚Äòworst‚Äô- we‚Äôve looked for one, or a combination, of the following: design flaws, conceptual mistakes, being extremely dangerous, being unpleasant to fly, or obsolete at the point of service entry (and the type must have entered service). Grab a cup of tea, and prepare for ire as you read about ten machines they wanted your dad, grandad or great grandad to fly to war. I'd love to hear your opinions below.

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile.

In Theaters March 9.\n\nWatch the greenband trailer now: http://bit.ly/GringoOfficialTrailer\n\nAn exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth ‚Äî or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\n¬ª SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\n¬ª In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company‚Äôs Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hern√°n Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he‚Äôll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she‚Äôs having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he‚Äôs been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold‚Äôs prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it‚Äôs soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù), Malin Akerman (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù), Jake Lacy (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù), Joe Manganiello (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù); as well as P.J.

See TOMB RAIDER in cinemas this March. #TombRaider\nFacebook.com/TombRaiderMovieUK/\nTwitter.com/WarnerBrosUK\nInstagram.com/warnerbrosuk\n\nLara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen.  Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent.  Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father‚Äôs global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he‚Äôs truly gone.  Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can‚Äôt understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.\n\nLeaving everything she knows behind, Lara goes in search of her dad‚Äôs last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan.  But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous.  Suddenly, the stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher for Lara, who‚Äîagainst the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit‚Äîmust learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.  If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, ‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero.  The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (‚ÄúEx Machina,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Danish Girl‚Äù) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (‚ÄúThe Wave‚Äù), with Oscar-winner Graham King (‚ÄúThe Departed‚Äù) producing under his GK Films banner.  The executive producers are Patrick McCormick, Denis O‚ÄôSullivan and Noah Hughes.\n‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù also stars Dominic West (‚ÄúMoney Monster,‚Äù ‚Äú300‚Äù), Walton Goggins (‚ÄúThe Hateful Eight,‚Äù ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù), Daniel Wu (AMC‚Äôs ‚ÄúInto the Badlands‚Äù) and Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas (‚ÄúThe English Patient‚Äù).\nUthaug directed from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons.  The director‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (‚ÄúMission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation‚Äù); production designer Gary Freeman (‚ÄúMaleficent‚Äù); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (‚ÄúSkyfall,‚Äù ‚ÄúGorillas in the Mist‚Äù) and editor Michael Tronick (‚ÄúSuicide Squad‚Äù); Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them‚Äù) and costume designer Timothy A. Wonsik (assistant costume designer, ‚ÄúFree State of Jones,‚Äù ‚ÄúIron Man 3‚Äù).  The music is by Tom Holkenborg (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù).\n\nWarner Bros.

I had a lot of scrap hardwood flooring from our home renovations, so I found some really beautiful pieces and got to work.\nMost of the sword is made from left over cumaru teak flooring that I recently used in our house. It has a really beautiful grain pattern and some elegant figuring, plus it's extremely dense and hard. I had just finished watching Alec Steele's series on making a Damascus steel katana, so I had a rough idea on how the whole thing went together.\n\nFirst, I drew out the rough shape of the blade based on some online dimensions. I cut out this shape on the bandsaw making sure to leave a tang on the bottom that would fit inside the hilt. I rough sanded the blade to give the sword some definition and moved on to the tsuba, or hand guard.\n\nI found another smaller piece of teak flooring for the tsuba. I used some calipers to measure the tang dimensions and transferred those lines to the blank tsuba. I drilled out this space and had to chisel and file the pocket very carefully so that the blade tang would sit snuggly into it. After I had a good fit, ¬†I cut the tsuba into an oval using a paper template.\n\nAfter researching how katana hilts are wrapped in cotton or silk strips, I decided to recreate that look with an inlayed contrasting wood. I had a piece of scrap oak flooring from my boys' room which would look awesome against the teak hilt. While I worked on other projects, I had my friend Josh CNC out the hilt design and the resulting diamond pattern looked just like a traditional fabric wrap.¬†I hogged out the inside of the hilt to receive the tang and once I got a snug fit, it was time to assemble the major components.\n\nThe tsuba fit onto the tang and the tang fit into the hilt. I added a kashira or pommel to the end of the hilt and it was all done. I finished the katana with some linseed oil and beeswax polish and it looks gorgeous! I am so happy to have my own sword and I feel like a true samurai!\n\nIf you liked this woodworking prop, check out the playlist above for more!"

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it‚Äôs soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù), Malin Akerman (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù), Jake Lacy (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù), Joe Manganiello (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù); as well as P.J.

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there‚Äôs a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it‚Äôs great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from ‚Äî some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

0x7c6,25.0,"I tried the intense diet and fitness regimens that 40-year-old NFL quarterback Tom Brady touts in his new book The TB 12 Method. Along with a diet that's heavy on vegetables and lean protein, Brady stays away from alcohol, caffeine, dairy, and sugar. \n\nThis is what it was like to eat and train like Tom Brady for a week, including a taste test of the avocado ice cream Brady is known to enjoy. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nI just tried the Tom Brady diet for a week. So, Tom Brady's got this new book called The TB12 Method. In the book, he outlines in detail the fitness regimens he undertakes and diet as well. Tom Brady's nutrition plan definitely made me tweak my already-okay diet. \n\nIn terms of the food that I ate during the week, you're staying away from sugars and dairies and refined carbohydrates, etc. It's a lot of vegetables, lean white meats. We had ground turkey burgers over lots of greens, peppers, and carrots. We also had a grilled chicken breast, some Brussels sprouts, and then quinoa. Then during the day, I would eat an apple. I would eat almonds.\n\nTom Brady is all about the hydration and constantly drinking water. It's recommended that you take your total body weight, cut that in half, and then drink the corresponding amount of ounces of water that's half your body weight. Every day I would drink approximately 90 ounces of water. Three big Poland Spring bottles of water.\n\nIn terms of caffeine, I usually drink like four cups of coffee a day on average, which is a lot. It's too much. Tom Brady ‚Äî he does not drink caffeine, but he recommended a maximum amount of 200 milligrams of caffeine a day,  and that equals two cups of coffee.\n\nIn terms of alcohol, Tom Brady, in the book, says that he does occasionally have a cocktail, but he says that, if you're going to drink alcohol, you need to match the ounce-amount of alcohol that you drink with water. So if you have a 12-ounce beer, you need to drink a 12-ounce glass of water.\n\nOne of the dishes that I tried was the avocado ice cream, which Tom Brady's been famous for making before. I wasn't a fan of the avocado ice cream. Sorry, Tom.\n\nOverall, the Tom Brady TB12 experience was a big improvement over my regular routine. I love always focusing on eating healthy and avoiding unhealthy, rich, sugary foods. I think this is definitely a positive tweak for me. I feel like it's already had a positive impact on me. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

0x7ce,22.0,"Testing the heat loss in my off grid log cabin, I use my infrared thermal imaging camera to take night time photos of the cabin while the wood stove is on, and then again the following morning when the fire is no longer burning. My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

Rogen has entered into a lifetime deal to transfer full ownership of his personal autonomy to Netflix, Inc. \n\n‚ÄúI have known Seth for many years‚Äù said senior Netflix Development Executive Jareth Chumley. ‚ÄúAfter a wrap party in late 2017, Seth approached me and said something like ‚ÄòJesus Fucking Christ Jarbear, I would sell my soul for a fuckin enchilada right now.‚Äô And so basically that was how the idea was born. In the end we settled on a price a little higher than a standard Chili‚Äôs To-Go entree, but I‚Äôll be damned, not by that much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs a general rule, I don‚Äôt really ‚Äòread‚Äô anything before I sign it,‚Äù replied Rogen when asked about the deal, spilling some beer on his own head as he does the finger-symbol equivalent of air quotes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Danny is for, he handles that for me, mostly,‚Äù gesturing toward an elderly man in a poncho sleeping on the couch behind him. ‚ÄúHey Danny!‚Äù he shouts, unable to wake his senior contract advisor. ‚ÄúI really hope he didn‚Äôt fuck this up. He‚Äôs the reason that Zach and Miri Make a Porno exists.‚Äù\n\nSeth Rogen‚Äôs Hilarity for Charity is the first project where Netflix was able to successfully extract comedy directly from the actor‚Äôs mind. It will stream April 6. While the remaining projects Rogen will be participating in have not yet been finalized, Netflix is considering a live-action Shrek remake, starring Rogen as both the titular character, as well as that character‚Äôs love interest Fiona. There will also be other tasks considered, including some off-camera roles such as ‚Äúexecutive foot massager‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuentin‚Äôs back waxer‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe world really is our oyster here,‚Äù said Netflix Chief Operations Officer Karen Shartwell. ‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt anything on earth that we can‚Äôt make him do.‚Äù\n\nWatch Hilarity For Charity on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80189646\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world‚Äôs leading Internet television network with over 117 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

0x7e1,22.0,"Testing the heat loss in my off grid log cabin, I use my infrared thermal imaging camera to take night time photos of the cabin while the wood stove is on, and then again the following morning when the fire is no longer burning. My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

I don‚Äôt think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices.

Such shelves are important because they hold back a vast amount of ice. If all such West Antarctic shelves were to collapse and spill the ice into the ocean then global sea level would rise by 10 feet. Beneath the Ross Ice Shelf is one of the least explored bits of ocean on Earth. New Zealand scientists used a hot-water drill hose to create a hole through the thick ice until they reached the perpetually dark water. They hoped to study the health and history of the shelf. Their findings surprised them. They found that the ice in the hole itself and along the base of the shelf was crystalizing and freezing rather than melting. Measurements will be taken for the next few years, to see how the Ross Ice Shelf is changing over time.\n\nRead more in Deep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected\n\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/ross-ice-shelf-bore-antarctica-freezing/\n\nDeep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/fyjt5zpNAeg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

In this video I show what this little Arduino/Raspberry Pi powered stepper robot arm with record and play functionality is capable to do.\n\nHere's a blog post about this project:\nhttps://electrondust.com/2018/01/21/small-stepper-robot-arm/\n\nA really quick summary on how it works:\n- The Gripper uses a servo which is controlled by the Raspberry Pi.\n- This robot arm uses 4 cheap geared stepping motors. \n- The motors are powered by 4 A4988 drivers. \n- The drivers are controlled by an Arduino Mega running a modified version of grbl:\nhttps://github.com/dguerizec/grbl-Mega-4axis\n- The Arduino waits for movement commands coming in via serial port.\n- The movement comments are being sent from a Raspberry Pi.\n- The replica arm which is used to control the pose of the arm is mode of 4 potentiometers.\n- The potentiometers are connected to a MCP3006 (this is a A/D converter chip). The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm

You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you‚Äôre having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn‚Äôt good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i‚Äôm 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith. This is not good to hear :("

Why isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòOff to the Vet‚Äô available in full on YouTube? A. ‚ÄòOff to the Vet‚Äô film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon‚Äôs Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon‚Äôs Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: \nhttp://www.shop.simonscat.com"

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\nÔºçSukiyaki SauceÔºç\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\nÔºçVegetablesÔºç\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25¬∞C/77¬∞F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15¬∞C/59¬∞F 20 hours\nWinter: 5¬∞C/41¬∞F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75¬∞C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

0x8cc,27.0,"In G√∂ttingen, Germany, there's a four-tonne steel ball that can be raised up a 14-metre tower -- and then dropped in less than two seconds, crashing back to earth. It makes tiny, artificial earthquakes: here's why.\n\nThanks to all the team at Wiechert'sche Erdbebenwarte G√∂ttingen! You can find out more about them here: https://www.erdbebenwarte.de/\n\nThree things I had to cut out of this video, because they didn't quite fit into the story or because I couldn't film them:\n\nThe reason the steel ball survived two world wars is because the university's records listed it by use as a rock-ball, not by composition as a steel ball - so no-one melted it down for weaponry.\n\nThe observatory team refill that pit every year to make the ground flat, and the ball just digs a hole again. The rock's just being compressed underneath. They joke that, somewhere in Australia, there's a slowly growing hill...\n\nAnd finally, the ground steams for a little while after the ball hits: it gets rather warm...\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin (@mrsmmartin)\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

It can be a stressful journey that involves cars, trains, bicycles, and even airplanes. This video breaks down the pros and cons of long commutes -- it's by someone who actually has a painfully long one: Vox's Kimberly Mas commutes to Manhattan almost every day. She drives her car to the train station, takes the train to the subway, and finally rides the subway to the Vox office. She's had this routine for a long time and she always wondered what kind of toll it's taking on her.

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\nÔºçSukiyaki SauceÔºç\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\nÔºçVegetablesÔºç\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25¬∞C/77¬∞F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15¬∞C/59¬∞F 20 hours\nWinter: 5¬∞C/41¬∞F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75¬∞C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

But two months before the Rape of Nanking in China, and a year before Kristallnacht in Germany, a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

In late November the San Francisco Conservatory of Music hosted the fifth annual installment of ‚ÄúTechapella,‚Äùa showcase for the a cappella singing clubs of some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThe event was founded by Laolee Xiong, a security specialist at Facebook. It was initially a way to have a competition with his friends who sang in Google‚Äôs group, ‚ÄúGoogapella.‚Äù Then he mentioned it to his friend at Google and suggested that they do ‚Äúsome kind of Pitch Perfect-style sing-off,‚Äù said Xiong.\n\nAfter an informal singing battle at each of the tech giant‚Äôs campuses, the a cappella groups from other companies (Twitter has ‚ÄúThe Song Birds‚Äù and Pinterest has ‚Äúthe Pintunes‚Äù) reached out to Xiong to organize a larger event, and ‚ÄúTechapella‚Äù was born.

We used 2 teaspoons of shea butter and 1 teaspoon of cocoa butter. Mix. \nTip: Use less shea butter and cocoa butter for a more pigmented lip balm, and more shea butter and cocoa butter for a more subtle tinted lip balm. \nPour the mixture into a container and let it sit to cool. \nUse like a regular lip balm. \n\n\nCandle Melts\n\nMATERIALS\nTweezers\nAlmost empty candle jars\nSilicone mold\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace your candle jar into a pot filled with hot water (with the water line not passing the middle of the jar) and allow the wax to melt completely. \nRemove any wicks with a pair of tweezers. \nCarefully remove the candle jar from the hot water and pour the melted wax into the silicone mold. \nLet the candle wax harden completely. \nEnjoy by using in a candle warmer. \n\n\nMustard Salad Dressing\n\nMATERIALS\nAlmost empty mustard bottle\nHoney\nOlive oil\nApple cider vinegar\nSalt \nPepper\n\n \nINSTRUCTIONS \nIf you‚Äôre having trouble getting use out of the mustard at the bottom of the bottle, this is perfect for you! Open the top of the bottle and pour in the ingredients necessary to make a delicious salad dressing. We went for a basic mustard vinaigrette using honey (to taste), 3 parts olive oil, one part apple cider vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. \nOptional: Add other herbs for extra flavor. \nSeal the bottle back up and shake it to mix the ingredients.

Close the container and give it a shake. \nLeave for 24 hours. \nAll of the essential oil residue that was left inside the empty bottle will have been absorbed by the epsom salt, leaving behind a deliciously scented epsom salt. \n\n\nNail Polish Marbling\n\nMATERIALS\nPlastic container\nNail polish\nPointed stirring stick or wooden skewer\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nFill your plastic container approximately halfway with warm water. \nSwirl nail polish over it, use your stick to create a design.

0x9d3,15.0,A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.

0x9de,22.0,"This video lets you see a different aspect of a doctor's life. For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital. I believe it's a crucial topic and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nCOMMENT BELOW - I am really looking forward to having a conversation with you guys and hearing your thoughts!\n\nSUBSCRIBE to experience more of my journey as a junior doctor! \n\n~ Siobhan (aka Violin MD) ~\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n‚ô´ Background Music ‚ô´ \n\nRhodesia by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 - Scherzo"

0x9f3,1.0,"Opening in theaters and VOD January 12th\n\nDirected by: Trudie Styler\nStarring: Bette Midler, Laverne Cox, Alex Lawther, Abigail Breslin & AnnaSophia Robb\n\nBilly Bloom (Alex Lawther, The Imitation Game) is one-of-a-kind: a fabulous, glitter-bedecked, gender-bending teenager whose razor-sharp wit is matched only his by his outrageous, anything-goes fashion sense. When his glamorous mother (Bette Midler) is forced to send him to live with his straight-laced father (Larry Pine), Billy finds himself a diva-out-of-water at his new ultra-conservative high school. Undaunted by the bullies who don‚Äôt understand him, the fearless Billy sets out to make a big statement in his own inimitable way: challenging the school‚Äôs reigning mean girl (Abigail Breslin) for the title of homecoming queen. This proudly offbeat comedy is an irresistible ode to outsiders and nonconformists of all stripes. \n\n#IFCFilms #Freakshow\n\nSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTube\n\nConnect with IFC Online\nIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.com\nFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilms\nFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficial\nFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms"

Concrete is usually stamped with mats, which requires moving each mat into place and pushing them into place.\n\nThe Rock 'N' Roller allows you to stamp concrete 5 times faster than mats according to Marshalltown. Once the concrete is flattened you simply spray the concrete and roller with a liquid release agent, then roll it over the surface. \n\nThey can be up to 90cm wide, and come in a variety of sizes for different jobs.\n_______________________________\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she‚Äôs having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he‚Äôs been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold‚Äôs prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.\n\nOfficial Site  ‚Äì www.gringo-movie.com  \n\nGet More from Amazon Studios: \nOfficial site: http://bit.ly/GetMoreAmazonStudios\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosInstagram\n\nAbout Amazon Studios:\nThe goal of Amazon Studios is to turn original stories into great entertainment.\n\nGringo - Official Redband Trailer [HD] | Amazon Studios\nhttps://youtu.be/MnKbM9Zxtn8\n\nAmazon Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/AmazonStudios"

0xa6c,26.0,"Earthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you‚Äôre prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you‚Äôre prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don‚Äôt forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you‚Äôll need, medications, and supplies that you‚Äôll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don‚Äôt require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt‚Äôs best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

0xa80,22.0,"I built an A frame hut as a large work space for projects. First I made a celt hatchet to cut timber for the hut. The axe head was made of amphibolite and the handle was made of a species of wattle. For the hut the floor plan was 4 X 4m. The height of the ridgeline was 2 m above the ground. +A post was planted in the ground to support the ridge pole at the back of the structure and an A frame was put in the front to support the ridgeline. The rafters of the hut were then attached to the ridgepole. Palm fronds were then collected, split and lashed to this frame. The dome hut was disassembled and its thatch was added to the structure. Approximately 1200 fronds were used in total. For the ridgeline, thatch was lifted in place and rested on without lashing it down. Instead, pairs of sticks lashed together were lifted in place sitting over thatch preventing it from blowing away. These are known as ‚Äújockeys‚Äù as they resemble a rider sitting on a horse.\nA wall of wattle and daub was built at the back of the structure. Wooden poles were planted into the ground and lawyer cane was woven between them. Soil was dug from around the hut forming drainage trenches while also supplying the mud used to daub the wall. No fibre was added to the daub, just straight mud. Pegs were stuck into the wall to form a convenient rack to hold the stone axe off the ground when not in use. Later, pegs were added to support the fire sticks too. A bed was made by hammering in wooden stakes and lashing timber to the frame. This was covered with palm fibre to act as bedding. Atherton oak nuts were then collected and eaten/stored in a pot. Latter, heavy rain fell testing the huts ability to shed rain. The hut stayed dry while the water flowed off the thatch and into the drainage trenches left over from digging the mud for the wall.\nThe A frame hut is a simple shelter that can be built quickly and simply. It‚Äôs basically a large roof built directly on the ground. The shape is strong and should resist strong winds. This hut is the biggest one I‚Äôve built on this channel and could fit both the tiled roof hut and wattle and daub hut inside it with room left over along the sides. It requires no scaffolding or ladders to build. A person can walk right down the centre without ducking while the sides that are too low to stand in are used for storing firewood, tools and other things. A fire lit in the entrance will greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes in the hut though it will get smokey occasionally. To reduce smoke, a small stove could be built to burn the wood more efficiently. A chimney and fireplace could be built also, but would take more time.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father‚Äôs legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)‚Äîwho is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious‚Äô Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. \n\nPacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S.

0xadd,15.0,A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video near the town of Woolgoolga in NSW.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her.

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‚Äòreturn to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander‚Äôs household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids ‚Äì where anyone could be a spy for Gilead ‚Äì all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! üòä\n‚óèYOUTUBERS in dominoes ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\n‚óèMy BEST domino projects ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\n‚óèVideo games/movies in dominoes ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù), Greg Berlanti (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù), Sarah Schechter (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision"

0xb44,28.0,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven‚Äôt seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It‚Äôs a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they‚Äôve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it‚Äôs about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"
0xb45,22.0,"The Riverdale cast visits The Paley Fest for their annual panel.\n_\n\nAbout  ‚Ñùiverdale:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \n\n_\n\nJoin The ‚Ñùiverdale Family and Subscribe:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCttRug-iudQuDgdFRLfm4Qw\n\n_\n\nWatch ‚Ñùiverdale:\n‚û§On Netflix\nhttps://www.netflix.com/vn/title/80133311\n\n‚û§Every Week On The CW (9/8c Wednesdays) \nhttp://www.cwtv.com/shows/riverdale/view-in-app/\n\n_\n\nConnect with ‚Ñùiverdale Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverd...\n\n_\n\n[TAGS]\n\nRiverdale\nArchie Comics\nRiverdale Chapter\nRiverdale Season 1\nRiverdale Season 2 \n\nMain Characters:\n\nArchie Andrews\nVeronica lodge\nBetty Cooper\nJughead Jones\nCheryl Blossom \nKevin Keller\nJosie McCoy\n\nShips:\n\nVarchie\nArchieronnie\nBughead\nBeronica\nBarchie\nJeronica\n\nThe Cast:\n\nKj Apa\nCamila Mendes\nLili reinhart\nCole Sprouse\nMadelaine Petsch\nCasey Cott\nAshleigh Murray"

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl‚Äôs generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it‚Äôs a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who‚Äîa young girl overflowing with holiday cheer‚Äîplots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch‚Äôs more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos‚Äô holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018."

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out!

See TOMB RAIDER in cinemas this March. #TombRaider\nFacebook.com/TombRaiderMovieUK/\nTwitter.com/WarnerBrosUK\nInstagram.com/warnerbrosuk\n\nLara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen.  Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent.  Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father‚Äôs global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he‚Äôs truly gone.  Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can‚Äôt understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.\n\nLeaving everything she knows behind, Lara goes in search of her dad‚Äôs last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan.  But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous.  Suddenly, the stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher for Lara, who‚Äîagainst the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit‚Äîmust learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.  If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, ‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero.  The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (‚ÄúEx Machina,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Danish Girl‚Äù) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (‚ÄúThe Wave‚Äù), with Oscar-winner Graham King (‚ÄúThe Departed‚Äù) producing under his GK Films banner.  The executive producers are Patrick McCormick, Denis O‚ÄôSullivan and Noah Hughes.\n‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù also stars Dominic West (‚ÄúMoney Monster,‚Äù ‚Äú300‚Äù), Walton Goggins (‚ÄúThe Hateful Eight,‚Äù ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù), Daniel Wu (AMC‚Äôs ‚ÄúInto the Badlands‚Äù) and Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas (‚ÄúThe English Patient‚Äù).\nUthaug directed from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons.  The director‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography George Richmond (‚ÄúMission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation‚Äù); production designer Gary Freeman (‚ÄúMaleficent‚Äù); Oscar-nominated editor Stuart Baird (‚ÄúSkyfall,‚Äù ‚ÄúGorillas in the Mist‚Äù) and editor Michael Tronick (‚ÄúSuicide Squad‚Äù); Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them‚Äù) and costume designer Timothy A. Wonsik (assistant costume designer, ‚ÄúFree State of Jones,‚Äù ‚ÄúIron Man 3‚Äù).  The music is by Tom Holkenborg (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures present, a Square Enix production, a GK Films production, ‚ÄúTomb Raider.‚Äù \n\nSet for release beginning March 16, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

The impact was a climactic event that likely contributed to dinosaur extinction. Today, Earth remains vulnerable to asteroid collisions. In recent history, space rocks have landed in The United States, Russia, and elsewhere. In the event of a potential asteroid collision, NASA has developed several options for dealing with the threat. Researchers at NASA‚Äôs Center for Near Earth Object Studies and Jet Propulsion Laboratory have proposed using blunt force, weaponized deflection or a theoretical tool called a gravity tractor to deflect impact. In addition to developing contingency plans, NASA scientists are also searching the sky for future asteroid threats.

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends.

0xc21,28.0,"Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

In Theaters March 9.\n\nWatch the greenband trailer now: http://bit.ly/GringoOfficialTrailer\n\nAn exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth ‚Äî or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\n¬ª SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\n¬ª In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company‚Äôs Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hern√°n Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he‚Äôll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she‚Äôs having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he‚Äôs been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold‚Äôs prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.\n\nOfficial Site  ‚Äì www.gringo-movie.com  \n\nGet More from Amazon Studios: \nOfficial site: http://bit.ly/GetMoreAmazonStudios\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosInstagram\n\nAbout Amazon Studios:\nThe goal of Amazon Studios is to turn original stories into great entertainment.\n\nGringo - Official Redband Trailer [HD] | Amazon Studios\nhttps://youtu.be/MnKbM9Zxtn8\n\nAmazon Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/AmazonStudios"

Loved Coco, and the short wasn‚Äôt bad, but at north of 20 minutes long it just made for a lot longer evening for the kids than I was banking on. Did Disney actually hear the complaints and pull it from the screenings?\n\nHussain Shah - Hi John, congrats on 100,000 subs just waiting for the other 900,000 to find your fantastic channel. I'm wondering your thoughts on Netflix's Oscar chances? Do you feel they'll have a chance or do the academy just have a prejudice against online streaming? They're releasing a film a week next year, surely one will get recognised at least. \n\nVictor - Hi John, awesome show. Super baffled by 20th Century Fox‚Äôs decision to fire Bryan Singer from the Bohemian Rhapsody movie - especially after reading Singer‚Äôs comments about needing time for family health issues. Is this a smart move by 20th Century Fox? Why not keep him on board in some advisory capacity, whilst bringing in a co-director who can complete shooting? Something doesn‚Äôt add up... Thanks!\n\nZR J-Ro - My question was could Tarintino‚Äôs Star Trek be Rated R since most of, if not not all, of his movies are?\n\nRebecca VanDerween - I‚Äôm seeing a lot of excitement for Avengers Infinity War. The trailer was just amazing. But after the recent choke job of Justice League, should we be nervous that Infinity War could crash and burn like it did? Why should we feel confident that Avengers will work where Justice League failed?"

0xc7c,24.0,"Check out what British soldiers ate during The Second Boer Conflict of 1899-1902 when in a last ditch effort !

And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar.

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\nÔºçSukiyaki SauceÔºç\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\nÔºçVegetablesÔºç\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25¬∞C/77¬∞F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15¬∞C/59¬∞F 20 hours\nWinter: 5¬∞C/41¬∞F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75¬∞C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well."

Never cracked or dropped my phone in water since i owned a cell phone)\n-3 weeks later phone completely drains *slept with a few percent left in battery.\n-plugged charger to phone. \n-phone wont charge\n-called samsung , transferred to tech support, trouble shoot, then repair ticket started (3-4 week wait according to rep)\n-needing a phone was an issue so i called sprint to see if they could help me with my problem. Tech support, troubleshoot, cant help me because i didnt buy insurance, said i still would have to pay $75 for a replacement even with insurance(even if they sold me a lemon phone that was less than a month old) told me to go to a sprint store to see if they could help.\n-went to sprint store , waited 45 min , repair tech troubleshoot phone ,phone still not responding. \n-tech checks my account status to see what they could do, said i didnt have insurance so they couldnt do an exchange. Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery.

0xc9a,24.0,"The Grinch - Official Trailer\nIn Theaters November 9\nhttps://www.grinchmovie.com\n\n\nFor their eighth fully animated feature, Illumination and Universal Pictures present The Grinch, based on Dr. Seuss‚Äô beloved holiday classic.  The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl‚Äôs generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it‚Äôs a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who‚Äîa young girl overflowing with holiday cheer‚Äîplots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch‚Äôs more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos‚Äô holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018."

0xcb2,10.0,"Higher is the title song for Wildlife feature film Wild Amsterdam playing in cinemas across Holland now. More info: http://dutchnaturefilms.com. Taken from the album Don Diablo - FUTURE: http://www.tinyurl.com/DonDiabloFuture  \n\nA few years ago I had the honour of making the end credit as well as the title song for an independent film called The New Wilderness. Much to everyones surprise that film ended up becoming one of the highest grossing films in Dutch cinema history and a sequel seemed inevitable. That sequel is finally here and when they asked me to provide a title song once more I couldn't refuse. I love the passion, dedication and patience the film makers put into these films and being a longtime inhabitant of Amsterdam myself it felt extra special to be a part of this incredible project. \n\nDirected by: Mark Verkerk\nProduced by: Ignas van Schaick \nEdit: Thomas Pieket Weeserik \nAdditional Camerawork: Patrick Van Der Wal \nSFX: Erik Middendorp\nExecutive Producer: Don Diablo\n\nProduction Company: EMS Films Holland \n\n‚¨°‚¨¢ Don Diablo ‚¨¢‚¨°\nSpotify ‚¨° http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo\nMerch ‚¨° http://shop.dondiablo.com\nInstagram ‚¨° http://instagram.com/dondiablo\nFacebook ‚¨° http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo\nTwitter ‚¨° http://twitter.com/dondiablo\nYouTube ‚¨° http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1\nSoundCloud ‚¨° http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo"

The film follows the course of the friends‚Äô lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (‚ÄúHall Pass,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù); Judy Greer (‚ÄúWar for the Planet of the Apes‚Äù); Ray Corasani (TV‚Äôs upcoming ‚ÄúThe Long Road Home‚Äù); PJ Byrne (‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù); Tony Hale (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù); and Thomas Lennon (‚ÄúTransformers: Age of Extinction‚Äù).  Paul-Mik√©l Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (‚ÄúSully,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Sniper‚Äù) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film‚Äôs executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood‚Äôs previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood‚Äôs costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut ‚ÄúSully,‚Äù and that film‚Äôs composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in ‚ÄúSully‚Äù and in ‚ÄúDunkirk,‚Äù serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris.‚Äù  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

Not everything wows like gravitational waves or spacefaring sportscars. That‚Äôs the case with the recent discovery of earliest stars in the universe. In a Nature paper published a few weeks ago, Judd Bowman and collaborators report a signal from the very first stars to form in our universe. The same result also hints at brand new physics that may help explain the nature of dark matter. This result flew under the radar in part because it‚Äôs a subtle and clever result that requires a bit of interpretation. Today we‚Äôre doing a Space Time Journal Club to explain this discovery.

0xcff,28.0,"It's the second SpaceX launch of 2018! SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a 4200 KG satellite called GovSat-1/SES-16 to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. This satellite serves the Luxembourg Government and a commercial customer SES. This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX. This is the 29th launch from SpaceX's launch pad, SLC-40, and the 48th over all launch of the Falcon 9. \n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/"

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150"

0xd20,27.0,"It's a humbling situation, but much about who we are as adults can be traced back to things that happened to us before our 12th birthday. Part of learning to be an adulthood means making sense of the events of our childhood. We need to spot how our past might be trying to interfere with our chances in the present.

Our childhoods, even the apparently benign ones, leave us no option but to be anything else.\nAs a result of these childhoods, we tend, over most issues, to list ‚Äì like a sailing yacht in high wind ‚Äì far too much in one direction or another. We are too timid, or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or as desperate for another to complete us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end. What is certain is that these imbalances come at a huge cost, rendering us less able to exploit our talents and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying lives and a great deal less fun to be around‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/6ubziU\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://goo.gl/qf1h3j\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/b7FNXL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDirected by: Hannah & Martha¬†\n\nDesign: Hannah McNally\n\nAnimation Team: Flora Caulton, Emily Downe, Martha Halliday, Hannah McNally, Kathrin Steinbacher¬†\n\nwww.hannahandmartha.com\n\nwww.floracaulton.co.uk\n\nwww.emilydowne.co.uk\n\nwww.kathrinsteinbacher.com"

0xd46,10.0,"Hey we found a solution to the problem of the magnetized marbles for the Marble Machine X! This demagnetizer / degausser is purely mechanical, just what i hoped for. By using disc magnets, with the polarities arranged in an alternate pattern we can very effectively demagnetize the marbles by letting them enter and exit the alternating magnetic field. \n\nCheck out Play With Junks Youtubevideo that helped convince me of this method: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-s_oXe9tmk\n\nBTW I read on Wikipedia that magnetism is nowadays considered a truly quantum mechanical effect, one which can not be explained by classical physics. Maybe that's why we never stop being mesmerized by magnetism. \n\nWe missed last Wednesday cause of problems with the video  again, will work hard to not miss out on Wednesdays like that.\n\nSome of you might see a Sponsor button that have popped up next to the subscribe button on the Wintergatan Channel. Its not shown all the time or on every platform. I am making an announcement video explaining this function but thought i just quickly mention what it is. A lot of you have asked us in the comments to start a Patreon page. We don't have a active Patreon page but recently Youtube reached out and asked us if we wanted to Beta-Test the Sponsorship function and we said yes. This function have been available for gaming channels for a long time but now Youtube is trying it out for other kinds of channels as well. Basically its a way for all of you who have asked us to start a Patreon page to support the Channel. More info on this in the upcoming channel update! \n\nAnyway, happy that Youtube reached out on this and happy that we found a mechanical way to demagnetize the marbles! \nHave a nice day everyone// Martin\n\nThanks to www.supermagnete.de for supporting the project by sending me the magnets for the Marble Machine X, these were the disc magnets used in the video:\nS-20-04-N Disc magnet: https://sumag.net/s-20-04-n-x01\n\nIf you want to support what we do: \n\n‚òÖSUBSCRIBE TO WINTERGATAN ON YOUTUBE https://www.youtube.com/user/wintergatan2000\n\n‚òÖDOWNLOAD WINTERGATAN MUSIC https://wintergatan.bandcamp.com/ \n\n‚òÖBUY PHYSICAL RECORDS OF WINTERGATAN MUSIC http://www.wintergatan.net/#/shop \n\n‚òÖLISTEN TO WINTERGATAN ON SPOTIFY http://bit.ly/2oKxXWd \n\n‚òÖLISTEN TO WINTERGATAN ON ITUNES http://apple.co/2ntWNsZ \n\n‚òÖSPONSOR The Wintergatan Channel on Youtube\n\nVideo Made by Martin Molin & Hannes Trainerds Knutsson\nSound mixed by Charlie Johansson\nEndscreen animation by Elinor Bergman"

0xd4a,24.0,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\n\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‚ÄòJustice League‚Äôs Tomatometer Score\n\n-Tarantino‚Äôs next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\n\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\n\n-‚ÄòHalloween‚Äô Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\n\n-What Women Want remake ‚ÄòWhat Men Want‚Äô in the works at Paramount; Empire‚Äôs Taraji P. Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won‚Äôt be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET‚Äînearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there‚Äôs a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it‚Äôs likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination‚Äôs Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse‚Äôs new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we‚Äôll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‚Äòs Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men‚Äôs thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA‚Äôs next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Learn more at http://omele.to/2n1IT2q.\n\nGeorge attends the competitive private school Auburn Academy, where he struggles to keep up with the other students.\n\nAuburn is a harsh, even cruel, place, full of overachievers who are often mean to the boy -- if they aren't completely ignoring him. It doesn't help that his dad is the school's janitor, either, who picks up his son in a rickety old car everyday.\n\nBut George's dad decides to stand up for his kid, showing just how far a parent will go to love and support their child -- even if it means possible further humiliation.\n\nDirector Andrew Mudge has crafted a sweet, delightful dramedy full of genuine heart and compassion. Its charming quirks -- minimal dialogue for the main characters, soaring score and meticulous and witty production design -- never overwhelm the film.\n\nThe Perfect Gooseys wears its sincerity and emotion proudly, earning every second of its touching finale -- and reminding us what really matters when it comes to what teach our families.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter ‚ñ∫ http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat ‚ñ∫ http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter ‚ñ∫ http://omeleto.com/join/\n\nüé¨ Got a film?

Once the concrete is flattened you simply spray the concrete and roller with a liquid release agent, then roll it over the surface. \n\nThey can be up to 90cm wide, and come in a variety of sizes for different jobs.\n_______________________________\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Sure enough, on the morning of January 2nd I pulled my car up to Nobadeer beach and there they were. This time, two friends surfed just beyond the icy eddie, hooting and hollering and holding up giant icebergs above their heads in neoprene gloved hands. I ran up and down the beach, taking as many shots as I could of this freezing, fleeting show of nature. Slurpee waves are the kind of thing you might only be lucky enough to see once, so I count myself as very lucky to have seen them twice.\n\nFilm & Photos:\nJonathan Nimerfroh\n@jdnphotography\nwww.jdnphotography.com\n\nEdit: KeDa Creative Group\n@kedacreative\nwww.kedacreative.com\n\nMusic: Electronic Pasture by Floyd Kellogg @floydkellogg\nwww.floydkellogg.com\n\nSurfers:\nJamie Briard @soil_surfer\n\nNick Hayden @nickhaydenpercussion\n\nThe Inertia: The Definitive Voice of Surf, Mountain, and Outdoors // http://www.theinertia.com \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/TheInertiaYT\n\nFollow us!\nhttps://twitter.com/the_inertia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheInertia\nhttp://instagram.com/theinertia\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/theinertia/"

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it‚Äôs called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let‚Äôs look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it‚Äôs one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one‚Äôs yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‚Äòlegs‚Äô so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

0xdaf,28.0,"On Wednesday, Jan. 24th, 2018 SpaceX completed the first static fire test of the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle.  When Falcon Heavy lifts off, it will be the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.  \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars."

0xdcd,28.0,"Made this printer out of a scanner, CD-ROM drive, mechanical hard drive, Arduino Duemilanove, Meccano, three motor driver boards, and a pencil.\n\nI use a point cloud software called CloudCompare to convert image data into a raster, and then export it as an ascii text file containing x,y,z,color values. Z is obviously always zero and is ignored. A value that isn't white for color tells the printer to smash the pencil (black and white only). X and y values are used to articulate the mechanisms. The reason I process the images this way is because it's just easier for me than figuring out how to read image files in Arduino code.\n\nTo print, the ascii text file is streamed over the usb serial connection to the Arduino via HyperTerminal (using XON/XOFF for flow control). Print resolution / size is 255 pixels wide by however long the scanner bed is.\n\nI believe it could also be useful in the kitchen for chopping vegetables."

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Of course we had to ramp things up by using a microcontroller to switch it on an off, but you can just use a high current power supply or variable transformer. Please double check the current rating vs. temperature of the manufacturers data sheet to make sure you're getting to the temperature needed. I stuck between 600 and 700 degree straight-wire temperatures. Google is your friend here! This video is just to get you started.

And it was totally worth it.\n\nWe wanted to make a video to pay homage to the good ol' days, so instead of heading to our computers to cook up some video graphics,, we went the stop-motion route. Speks is all about going off-screen and diving into shapeable, moldable, tactile fun. We like to think that our balls have endless possibilities with zero expectations. Our video shows just that. \n\nMoral of the story; If you want to create a mesmerizing stop-motion video with Speks, you can.

0xdff,28.0,"Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there‚Äôs nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I‚Äôve been excited for the movie but don‚Äôt know how to take the limited reactions I‚Äôve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that‚Äôs the case, why doesn‚Äôt Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason?

0xe20,24.0,"Timelapse video of a complete log cabin build by one man alone in the wilderness of Canada, from 1st tree I cut to last floor board I laid. If you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer. It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the Log Cabin The Bear Den playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nTo see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/"

Thoughts?\n\nRaymundo Lopez - Black Panther is now the MCU‚Äôs highest opening weekend for a stand alone movie. Do you think this gives confidence to Marvel that the MCU can survive and thrive once the original cast leaves? Do you also think this puts to rest the talks that the MCU needs to reboot after Thanos?\n\nJosh DeRose - After numerous false starts, it appears as though NBC might finally be moving forward with a companion series for The Office.

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends.

Animation is a slow process and Simon‚Äôs Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon‚Äôs Cat merchandise?\nA.

Here's how it works.\n\nSome people would have filmed their script on the ground, and just messed about while floating. I decided to go for something a bit more challenging.\n\n**\n\nIf you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and zero-g sounds like your thing, have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program: http://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_Your_Thesis -- the 2017-18 submissions are closed, but that just gives you time to start planning for next year...\n\n**\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy isn't Neil floating around the cabin in zero-g?: Sometimes, his feet are under a safety strap, so he doesn't drift away. Sometimes, he's holding on with one hand, and he's just that good at zero-g maneuvers.\n\nWhy's my face so red?: During the 1.8g phase, my heart has to work extra hard to pump blood up to my head -- when I switch to 0g, it takes a few seconds for it to slow pumping, so my blood pressure spikes.\n\nWhat stabilised camera did I use?: You're looking at footage from a GoPro Fusion, stabilised in post using Adobe After Effects and the telemetry from the plane's sensors.\n\nWhat did it feel like?: There'll be a behind-the-scenes video on the Matt and Tom channel on Saturday, hopefully!\n\n**\n\nCamera: Melanie Cowan\n\nThank you to everyone at ESA and Novespace who helped make this happen!\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

It's a simple question, though the answer is quite complicated. And it varies tremendously based on what car we're talking about. A $20,000 compact is far more simple than the $155,000 Mercedes S560 Cabriolet driven in this video. With that extra cost comes luxuriousness, the latest technology, and all kinds of features that most drivers will never even know the car has. \n\nOften, complexity is associated with unreliability, and though they may often correlate, that doesn't mean complexity causes unreliability. In the case of luxury cars, it's important to consider who the buyer is.

0xe9f,28.0,"Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Business began to take off once Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics while wearing Dassler sneakers. But with great success brought great competition. Soon, sibling rivalry split the brothers and their company apart, with each creating their own line of shoes. Today, Adidas and Puma continue to be leaders within the shoe industry, while brothers Adolf and Rudolph lie buried at opposite ends of a soccer field as their feud continues on into eternity.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Human Condition series.

0xf55,28.0,"This is a test fire in advance of SpaceX's upcoming Falcon Heavy test launch. The test occurred on 1/24/2018 at Kennedy Space Center's LC-39 Pad A which is the same pad that many Apollo and Space Shuttle launches took place from. SpaceX is currently leasing the pad from NASA. Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy."
0xf56,15.0,A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video near the town of Woolgoolga in NSW.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.

Because everything is in a tilted plane, the hard part was to find different ways of having the marble riding up along the table (magnets, falling weight, catapult ...). To do that, the marble has to be light. And because everything has to be triggered by this little marble, all the tricks are very unstable. Most fails happened when an element fall down earlier than expected.\n\nI learned a lot about chain reaction, and I discovered the amazing power of the hot glue gun !"

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and help navigate through the doorway.  Controllers provide locomotion, balance and adjust behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.

People are also underestimating The Guardians of the Galaxy and the pop that will bring to IW since a lot of people didn‚Äôt know they are even apart of the avengers. Thoughts?\n\nRaymundo Lopez - Black Panther is now the MCU‚Äôs highest opening weekend for a stand alone movie. Do you think this gives confidence to Marvel that the MCU can survive and thrive once the original cast leaves? Do you also think this puts to rest the talks that the MCU needs to reboot after Thanos?\n\nJosh DeRose - After numerous false starts, it appears as though NBC might finally be moving forward with a companion series for The Office. Assuming John Krasinski reprises his role, do you believe the show will live up to fan expectations?"

0x102e,28.0,"Caviar is one of the most expensive foods in the world. Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long.¬†\n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars.¬†\n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive.¬†\n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar.¬†Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs.¬†Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish.¬†It's called stripping.¬†The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs.¬†Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar ‚Äî just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs¬†Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

0x104b,22.0,"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty. Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a ‚Äúlid‚Äù to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes ‚Äúdead lime‚Äù, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It‚Äôs basically the ‚ÄòGlue‚Äô that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesn‚Äôt hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars. \n\nFor owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating.\n\nFor cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Football teams give cities a sense of identity and they are paying more than ever for them.\n\nNew stadiums aren‚Äôt the economic powerhouses owners promise they‚Äôll be. But as long there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like taxpayers are going to keep footing the bill.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

0x1063,28.0,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven‚Äôt seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It‚Äôs a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they‚Äôve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it‚Äôs about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

0x1068,22.0,"This video lets you see a different aspect of a doctor's life. For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital. I believe it's a crucial topic and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nCOMMENT BELOW - I am really looking forward to having a conversation with you guys and hearing your thoughts!\n\nSUBSCRIBE to experience more of my journey as a junior doctor! \n\n~ Siobhan (aka Violin MD) ~\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n‚ô´ Background Music ‚ô´ \n\nRhodesia by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 - Scherzo"

The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm

0x10df,24.0,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\n\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‚ÄòJustice League‚Äôs Tomatometer Score\n\n-Tarantino‚Äôs next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\n\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\n\n-‚ÄòHalloween‚Äô Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\n\n-What Women Want remake ‚ÄòWhat Men Want‚Äô in the works at Paramount; Empire‚Äôs Taraji P. Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won‚Äôt be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET‚Äînearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there‚Äôs a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it‚Äôs likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination‚Äôs Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse‚Äôs new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we‚Äôll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‚Äòs Taraji P.

The Green Book was a unique travel guide during this time, when segregation was practiced all over the country.\n\nThe book, which grew to cover locations in all 50 states, listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, beauty salons, and other services that would reliably serve African Americans. The listings grew from user correspondence and a network of African American postal workers under the guidance of Victor Hugo Green, the book‚Äôs publisher.\n\nThe American road trip would go on to be an anchor in the civil rights discussion, as it highlighted the injustices and prejudice that African Americans suffered under Jim Crow. Before the Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, Victor Green‚Äôs booklet helped black Americans navigate their country. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

0x10e8,25.0,"Almost half of all Best Actor and Actress awards have been won by method actors since 1951.\n\nGetting excited about the Oscars? Check out our expert analysis at Vox: http://bit.ly/2F7xfyW\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nMethod acting's foundational theory originated in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century. It was created by Konstantin Stanislavski and his peers at the Moscow Art Theater as a framework for systematically training young actors. Method acting became influential in the US in the ‚Äô30s and ‚Äô40s, pioneered by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, each of whom transformed and built on Stanislavski‚Äôs system.\n\nToday, training in method acting is ubiquitous for aspiring actors. But at the same time, the stakes of method acting continue to rise. First popularized in the US during the 1950s by Marlon Brando's generation of Hollywood stars, method acting continues to be a consistent way for actors to push themselves in new roles. But while method acting won Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, it's undeniable that the way method acting is promoted is conspicuously marketable. Still, it has undoubtedly led to some of the greatest performances of all time.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

0x10f4,26.0,"After finishing school, Jocelyn and Jarvis had $96,000 of debt from student loans, credit cards, and buying a small rural property.  This is the story of how they paid it off in just 20 months, and then built themselves a debt-free custom tiny house for their family of 4.\n\nAfter ignoring their finances for a long time, the couple finally faced reality one night when they sat down and added up all of their debts, and compared it to the revenue they had coming in.\n\nWhen they realized how much they owed, they decided to make some drastic changes so they could pay it off and stop worrying about money.\n\nTo start, they moved to a smaller apartment, changed jobs, shopped second-hand, froze a credit card in a block of ice, switched to using cash only, and made a budget that allowed them to chip away at their debt.\n\nThey had a white board with a list of all their debts, which they updated every time a payment was made so they'd continue to be motivated.  After 20 months, they were completely debt-free.  After that, they continued with their minimalist, frugal habits and were able to save up enough money to build themselves a custom tiny house on wheels.\n\nThey've been living in the tiny house for over two years now, with their two children, and plan to continue living in it for as long as they can.  They are currently saving money to buy a small acreage where they will build a larger off grid home and keep the tiny house as an income property.\n\nWe're very inspired by this young family's dedication to improve their lives by paying off their debt, by their awareness of their energy consumption, by their efforts to buy less and live a low waste lifestyle.\n\nThey're trying to make positive change in every aspect of their lives, and that's not always an easy thing to do.  \n\nThank you, Jocelyn and Jarvis, for sharing your story with us!

0x110a,1.0,"The Hudson Union www.hudsonunionsociety.com is where everyone comes to be inspired, to change our world.\n\nCheck us out on Twitter @ActualJoePascal\n\nBryan Cranston won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Walter White in AMC‚Äôs Breaking Bad. He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX‚Äôs Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy‚Äôs destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston‚Äôs riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

0x110f,28.0,"For more than half a decade I've suffered from lactose intolerance. If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

0x1169,2.0,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised the company's first electric semi-truck would be mind-blowing, and he delivered. \n\nMusk took the wraps off the big rig on Thursday at Tesla's Design Studio in Hawthorne, California, and the vehicle's design was definitely what got the most attention. \n\nThe semi can go 0-60 mph in five seconds without a trailer attached. \n\nThe big rig has an impressive range of 500 miles per charge. With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"
