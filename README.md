# Deep_learning-Nano-Degree

### Advance  Deep learning 

# Topics covered
### Introduction of Anaconda or jupyter Notebook
      Jupyter Notebook is a web app
      >> Magic word like % or %%
      >>can be accessed any where by using cloud computing .
      
     > & Anaconda is a
     >> Software distribution, package or Environment manager.\
     
     
     
### Neural networks Fundamentals 
    >>Perceptron algorithm 
    >>Error function 
    >>Discrete(Step funcion) or continuous(sigmoid) Error functions
    >>Softmax error function for multiclass classification
    #####  Gradient Descent Algorithm    
           GDA= - learning rate * gradient 
            In simple words - ve slope for improve error function
            
      #### Cross Entropy = -(sigma of ln(probability of predictions))
                           it shows how accurate a neural network workikng .
                                 
     #### Feed forwardation -->> process to take inputs and get final output 
     
     #### Backpropagation  is the central mechanism by which neural networks learn.
   
### Implementation of Gradient Descent with Multilayer perceptron

### Training of neural networks 

    overfitting vs underfitting ->> *in overfitting* training error is low but Testing error is high, *in underfittinng* Both errors
     are high.
     
     1./* Technique to remove overfitting*/ ->> Regularization  (L1,L2)
     2.[Dropout] : in this technique we drop some nodes which has more weight already or train only less
                   Weight contain nodes. 
* [Types of Gradient descent]:
  * 1.Batch GD : take all data point in each epoch
  * 2. Stochastic GD : Take different data-sets in each epoch
  * 3.Mini Batch Gd : SGD + BGD
